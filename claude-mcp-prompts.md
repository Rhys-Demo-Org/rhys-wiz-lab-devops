# Claude Desktop and Wiz MCP

## First Prompt
Afternoon claude, can you read the james-carty/wiz-lab-devops repository with the wiz-mcp and let me know what findings there are?
I am interested in anything related to vulnerabilities.

## Second Prompt
Would this docker image be suitable to port onto WizOS? 
What would I need to change?

## Final Prompt
Can you summarise this thread into a markdown file that I can add to the repository and work with Cluade Code on?
